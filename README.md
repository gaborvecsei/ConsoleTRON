# ConsoleTRON

This is a simple local multiplayer TRON game running on the console window.

That was my first homework for University when we learned C programming.
We had to create a project and that shining light bulb appeared above my head 
and this is how ConsoleTRON was born.

## The Game

I know that this is not a beautiful and optimized code, but back than 
I just learned how to code so I'm still proud. :)

Unfortunately it's in Hungarian but I think you can understand it easily.

This is a retro TRON clone running on the console window with characters representing the court and the players.
The rules are the same: try to be the last one who is alive. If you stumble into the other players wall than you are dead.
The same thing happens if you bump into an obstacle.
